        <p>No single food provides all the calories and nutrients the body needs to stay healthy. Thatâ€™s why a balanced
            diet consisting of macronutrients like carbohydrates, protein, and fat along with micronutrients such as

                    again. You may be missing out on something crucial that can impact your overall health.</p>
